# Archive Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains backup copies of the original monolithic documentation files that have been split into modular files.

**These files are for backup purposes only.** Do not edit or reference these files. Use the new modular documentation structure instead.

## When to Delete These Files

These backup files can be safely deleted once:
1. Git version control is set up for the project
2. You've verified all content is preserved in the new structure
3. You're comfortable with the new modular documentation

**Until then, these backups provide a safety net for recovery if needed.**
