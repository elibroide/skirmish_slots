# M2 Roadmap - PRIORITIZED for Playtester Appeal
## "Make it Showable - Make People WANT to Playtest"

**M1 Status:** ✅ Fully functional - core game works, network play works, AI works
**M2 Goal:** Make the game visually appealing and strategically deep enough that people are EXCITED to playtest, not doing you a favor

**Timeline:** No pressure - quality over speed

---

## PRIORITY TIER 1: CRITICAL - "Make it Look Like a Real Game"
*Without these, the game looks too blocky and playtesters won't engage*

### 1.1 🎨 Core Animation System (Foundation)
**Why Critical:** Animations provide clarity and make actions feel impactful. Without them, players don't know what's happening.

**Implementation Approach:**
Since ALL animations are critical but time isn't pressured, implement in phases:

**Phase 1A: Essential Clarity Animations (Week 1-2)**
These make the game UNDERSTANDABLE:
- [ ] **Unit Deployed**
  - Card slides from hand → slot with smooth arc
  - Unit "enters" with scale-up animation (0.3s)
  - Deploy effects trigger immediately after
  
- [ ] **Unit Takes Damage**
  - Flash red (0.2s)
  - Shake/recoil effect
  - Damage number floats up: "-3" in red text (fades out in 1s)
  
- [ ] **Shield Damaged/Depleted**
  - Shield icon glows when hit
  - Cracks appear as shield depletes
  - Shatters when fully gone (0.4s animation)
  
- [ ] **Unit Dies**
  - Fade out or disintegrate effect (0.5s)
  - Card slides to graveyard pile
  - Death effects trigger during fade
  
- [ ] **Unit Buffed**
  - Flash green or gold (0.2s)
  - Sparkle/glow effect
  - Buff value appears: "+2 Power" in green (fades in 1s)
  
- [ ] **Action Card Played**
  - Card moves from hand to center screen
  - Brief expansion to show effect (0.4s)
  - Effect resolves (with targeting line if applicable)
  - Card slides to graveyard

**Phase 1B: Game Flow Animations (Week 2-3)**
These make the game flow feel COMPLETE:
- [ ] **Cards Dealt (Round Start)**
  - Cards fly from deck → hand one by one (0.1s each)
  - Fanned out animation in hand
  
- [ ] **Round/Skirmish End**
  - Power comparison animation (numbers pulse)
  - Winner announcement per lane (green glow for won lanes)
  - Banner slides in: "Player 1 Wins Skirmish 1" (2s display)
  - Board clears (cards slide to graveyard)
  
- [ ] **Game End**
  - Final score animation
  - Winner celebration (confetti, glow, etc.)
  - "Player 1 Wins 2-1" banner (stays until dismissed)

**Phase 1C: Advanced Animations (Week 3-4)**
These add JUICE and make specific effects satisfying:
- [ ] **Projectile Attacks** (Archer, Turret, etc.)
  - Arrow/bolt fires from unit → target (0.3s travel)
  - Impact flash on target
  - Damage numbers appear
  
- [ ] **Unit Bounced**
  - Arc animation returning to hand (0.5s)
  - Whoosh effect
  
- [ ] **Slot Modified** (Ongoing Effect Added)
  - Glow effect pulses on slot (0.3s)
  - Icon appears showing effect type
  
- [ ] **Cleanse Effect**
  - Wipe/flash across unit (0.3s)
  - Keyword icons disappear
  
- [ ] **Leader Ability Activated**
  - Portrait glows/pulses (0.4s)
  - Visual effect (spark, aura, etc.)
  - If targeted, targeting line appears
  
- [ ] **Triggered Abilities** (On-board units)
  - Quick flash on triggering unit (0.2s)
  - Effect animation (specific to ability)
  - Example: Turret → muzzle flash → projectile → impact

**Animation System Requirements:**
- [ ] **Choose & Setup Animation Library**
  - Recommended: Framer Motion (React-friendly, good sequencing)
  - Alternative: React Spring (more control, steeper learning)
  
- [ ] **Animation Queue System**
  - Queue all game events: [Play card, Deal damage, Unit dies, etc.]
  - Process sequentially (wait for animation before next)
  - Allow fast-forward/skip (hold spacebar?)
  
- [ ] **Timing Control**
  - Control WHEN damage appears (sync with impact animation)
  - Example: Fireball → travel → explosion → show damage numbers
  
- [ ] **Customizable Assets per Source**
  - Map effect type → animation variant
  - Turret damage ≠ Wolf damage (different projectiles)
  - Build asset library over time

**Success Metric:** Playtesters say "it feels satisfying to play cards" and "I can follow what's happening"

---

### 1.2 🎴 Unit Art & Visual Identity
**Why Critical:** Blocky placeholder cards look amateur. Real art makes the game feel legitimate.

- [ ] **Cel-Shaded Art Style**
  - Establish style guide (color palette, line weight, shading approach)
  - Test with 3-5 cards first to validate style
  
- [ ] **Unit Stories → AI Art**
  - Write short story/description for each unit (3-5 sentences)
  - Example: "A grizzled veteran wielding a tower shield, she plants herself at the front line and refuses to budge. Her armor is battered but her resolve is unbreakable."
  - Feed to AI art generator (Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.)
  - Iterate on prompts to match cel-shaded style
  
- [ ] **Multi-Word Unit Names**
  - Replace generic names: "Scout" → "Emberwatch Scout"
  - Names hint at abilities: "Stoneheart Guardian" = defensive
  - 2-3 words per name
  
- [ ] **Card Frame Design**
  - Professional card frame template (borders, text boxes, stat areas)
  - Rarity-colored borders (Bronze = copper, Silver = silver, Gold = gold)
  - Clear stat display: Power/Shield in large numbers

**Production Pipeline:**
1. Prioritize cards by usage frequency (most-played cards get art first)
2. Start with ~20 core cards for initial playtests
3. Add more art as testing reveals which cards are keepers
4. Placeholders OK for rarely-played cards initially

**Success Metric:** Playtesters say "this looks like a real card game" and cards are visually distinct

---

### 1.3 🖼️ Two-Frame System (Full vs Board)
**Why Critical:** Cluttered board makes game hard to read. Clean board frame focuses on what matters.

**Full Frame (In Hand / Tooltips):**
- [ ] Complete card design with all text visible
- Shown when:
  - Card in hand
  - Hovering for tooltip
  - Deck builder
  - Graveyard viewer

**Board Frame (On Battlefield):**
- [ ] Simplified design focusing on art + power
- Large, centered Power/Shield numbers (easy lane comparison)
- Only show keyword icons (see 1.4)
- Minimal text (or none)
- Shown when: Unit deployed to slot

**Technical Implementation:**
- [ ] Two React components: `CardFull` and `CardBoard`
- [ ] Smooth transition animation when card moves hand → board
- [ ] Hover on board card shows full frame as tooltip

**Success Metric:** Playtesters can quickly see power levels at a glance, don't need to squint to read text

---

### 1.4 🏷️ Keyword Symbol Tags
**Why Critical:** Visual reminders reduce cognitive load - players don't re-read cards constantly.

**Icons to Create:**
- Shield (shield icon + value)
- Dominant (crown icon - glows when active)
- Death (skull icon)
- Deploy (down arrow or exclamation)
- Conquer (flag/trophy icon - shown on units that provide bonus SP when winning)
- Consume (eating/mouth icon)
- Heal (plus/heart icon)
- Bounce (return arrow)
- Activate (gear/button icon - for activated abilities)

**Display Rules:**
- [ ] Show as small icons on board frame (corners or top edge)
- [ ] Only relevant keywords (don't clutter)
- [ ] Tooltips on hover explain keywords
- [ ] Visual distinction: Active vs Inactive keywords (Dominant glows when leading)

**Success Metric:** New playtesters understand keywords without reading full card text

---

### 1.5 🎯 Rarity Visual System
**Why Critical:** Rarity must be obvious for deckbuilding constraints to work.

**On Cards in Hand:**
- [ ] Border color: Bronze = copper, Silver = silver, Gold = gold
- [ ] Rarity icon in corner (gem or star)
- [ ] Background texture/shine (Gold cards shimmer)

**On Board:**
- [ ] Subtle corner icon or border accent
- [ ] Don't overwhelm board frame (art is priority)

**In Deck Builder:**
- [ ] Clear text label: "Bronze" / "Silver" / "Gold"
- [ ] Color-coded backgrounds
- [ ] Rarity filter buttons

**Success Metric:** Playtesters never confused about card rarity, understand deckbuilding limits

---

### 1.6 🎮 Board & Slot Visual Improvements
**Why Critical:** Blocky board makes game feel amateur. Clear slot indication reduces targeting errors.

- [ ] **Split Realm Background**
  - Visually split board in middle (vertical line or gradient)
  - Player 1 side = one theme (forest, castle, etc.)
  - Player 2 side = different theme (volcanic, ruins, etc.)
  - Don't go overboard - keep battlefield readable
  
- [ ] **Slot Labels**
  - Show slot identifiers: "T0", "T1", "T2", "T3" (or "Left", "Mid-Left", etc.)
  - Small text, doesn't clutter
  - Helps communication: "Play on T2"
  
- [ ] **Targetable Slot Highlight**
  - When targeting slots, highlight valid options
  - Glow or outline effect
  - Different color for friendly vs enemy slots
  
- [ ] **Lead Indication**
  - Clear visual for which unit is leading each lane
  - Crown icon above unit OR glow effect
  - Critical for Dominant keyword
  
- [ ] **Lane Winner Indication**
  - At skirmish end, show who won which lane
  - Green glow for won lanes, red for lost
  - Display for 2-3 seconds
  
- [ ] **Slot Modifier Display**
  - Show ongoing effects attached to slots
  - Icon overlay on slot (hover for details)
  - Example: Slot has "Deploy: +1 Power" → shows sword/buff icon

**Success Metric:** Playtesters never misclick targets, instantly see who's winning lanes

---

### 1.7 👤 Player Area (Leader UI)
**Why Critical:** Leader is core mechanic - needs clear, accessible UI.

- [ ] **Leader Portrait**
  - Large portrait displaying leader's art
  - Location: Top corners of screen (Player 1 top-left, Player 2 top-right)
  - Shows player name + leader name below
  
- [ ] **Leader Activate Button**
  - Button next to portrait
  - Shows remaining charges: "Activate (2/3)"
  - Glows when available, grayed when unavailable
  - Tooltip explains why unavailable ("No charges" or "Wrong timing")
  
- [ ] **Leader Tooltip**
  - Hover over portrait → shows full leader card
  - Complete ability text + keyword explanations
  
- [ ] **Charge Visual Indicator**
  - 3 charge icons (filled or empty)
  - Example: ⚡⚡☆ (2 charges left)
  - Updates immediately when charge spent

**Success Metric:** Playtesters understand leader abilities and use them strategically

---

### 1.8 📊 Game Progress Display
**Why Critical:** Players need to know where they are in the match (turn, skirmish, score).

- [ ] **Turn Counter**
  - "Turn 5" displayed at top center
  - Updates each turn
  
- [ ] **Skirmish Indicator**
  - "Skirmish 1 of 3"
  - Clear indication which skirmish is active
  
- [ ] **Tennis-Style Scoreboard**
  - Shows SP history across all skirmishes
  - Example format:
    ```
    Player 1:  3  |  1  |  2   (Won skirmishes 1 & 3)
    Player 2:  2  |  4  |  2   (Won skirmish 2)
               S1    S2    S3
    ```
  - Color-code won skirmishes (green for win, red for loss)
  - Always visible, updates after each skirmish

**Success Metric:** Playtesters always know match status, never confused about score

---

### 1.9 🔘 Pass/Done Button (Manual Pass System)
**Why Critical:** Core gameplay change from M1 - must be clear and functional.

- [ ] **Done Button State**
  - Shown when: Player hasn't played cards or activated abilities
  - Label: "Done" (or "End Round")
  - Color: Green or default
  - Tooltip: "You haven't taken actions - clicking ends your round"
  - Effect: Locked out for rest of round
  
- [ ] **Pass Button State**
  - Shown when: Player HAS played cards or activated abilities
  - Label: "Pass" (or "Pass Priority")
  - Color: Different from Done (yellow/orange)
  - Tooltip: "Pass turn to opponent (you may get priority back)"
  - Effect: Pass turn, may get priority again
  
- [ ] **Smooth Transition**
  - Button appearance changes smoothly when state changes
  - Brief highlight/pulse when switching Done → Pass
  - Clear visual feedback

**Success Metric:** Playtesters understand the difference, no confusion about passing

---

### 1.10 🎴 Hand Interactions
**Why Critical:** Small details that make card handling feel good.

- [ ] **Card Raffling (Reordering)**
  - Drag cards to reorder in hand
  - Smooth drag-and-drop
  - Like MTG Arena
  
- [ ] **Card Disappears When Played**
  - Card animates out of hand (doesn't just gray out)
  - Slides to board or discard pile
  - More satisfying feedback

**Success Metric:** Playtesters say "the cards feel good to interact with"

---

## PRIORITY TIER 2: GAMEPLAY MECHANICS - "Make it Strategically Deep"
*New mechanics that improve strategic depth - these need playtesting*

### 2.1 👑 Leader System (Proven Mechanic)
**Why Important:** You've already tested this - it works. Adds consistent strategic value.

- [ ] **Leader Selection in Deck Build**
  - Choose 1 leader before game starts
  - Leader stored separately from deck
  
- [ ] **Leader Object Structure**
  ```javascript
  {
    name: "Commander Valeria",
    art: "valeria_portrait.png",
    ability: "Once per turn: Give a slot 'Deploy: +1 Power'",
    abilityType: "activated", // or "passive"
    maxCharges: 3,
    currentCharges: 3,
    chargesResetPerSkirmish: false // or true, TBD
  }
  ```
  
- [ ] **Quick Action System**
  - Leader abilities don't auto-pass turn
  - Player can activate multiple times in one turn (if charges available)
  - Integrate with Pass/Done button (1.9)
  
- [ ] **Charge Management**
  - Spend charges when ability activated
  - Track per skirmish or per match (decide based on playtesting)
  - UI updates immediately (see 1.7)
  
- [ ] **Example Leaders to Implement (Start with 3-5)**
  - Aggressive Leader: "Activated (1 charge): Deal 2 damage to an enemy"
  - Defensive Leader: "Passive: Your units with Shield get +1 Shield"
  - Tactical Leader: "Activated (1 charge): Move a unit to a close empty slot"
  - Control Leader: "Activated (1 charge): Remove an ongoing effect from a slot"
  - Value Leader: "Passive: When you sacrifice a unit, draw a card"

**Design Questions to Answer in Playtesting:**
- Do charges reset per skirmish or stay for whole match?
- How many charges is balanced? (3? 4? 5?)
- Should some leaders have more charges but weaker abilities?
- Are passive abilities as fun as activated?

**Success Metric:** Playtesters use leader abilities strategically, games feel more dynamic

---

### 2.2 🛡️ Shield Mechanic
**Why Important:** Adds durability without just buffing power. Creates tactical decisions (target shielded vs non-shielded).

- [ ] **Shield as Unit Stat**
  - Units have Power/Shield format: "5/2" = 5 power, 2 shield
  - Displayed clearly on cards (both frames)
  
- [ ] **Damage Reduction Logic**
  ```javascript
  // When unit takes damage:
  if (unit.shield >= damage) {
    unit.shield -= damage;
    // Power unaffected
  } else {
    const overflow = damage - unit.shield;
    unit.shield = 0;
    unit.power -= overflow;
  }
  ```
  
- [ ] **Shield Granting**
  - Units can grant shield: "Deploy: Shield 2" (self), "Give close allies Shield 1"
  - Actions can grant shield: "Give an ally Shield 3"
  
- [ ] **Visual System**
  - Shield icon with value on unit card
  - Shield bar or overlay on board frame
  - Animation when shield takes damage (see 1.1)

**Cards to Implement:**
- Shielded units (varying power/shield ratios)
- Shield-granting support units
- Anti-shield cards? ("Ignore shield when dealing damage")

**Success Metric:** Playtesters understand shield vs power, make targeting decisions based on shield

---

### 2.3 👑 Dominant Mechanic
**Why Important:** Creates dynamic lane control objectives. Rewards maintaining board position.

- [ ] **Dominant Keyword**
  - "Dominant: [Effect]"
  - Only active when unit is LEADING its lane (higher power than opponent)
  - Passive ability
  
- [ ] **Lead Detection**
  - Check after every power change in lane
  - Update Dominant status dynamically
  
- [ ] **Visual Indication**
  - Dominant keyword icon glows when active, grayed when inactive
  - Crown icon above unit when leading (see 1.6)
  
- [ ] **Example Dominant Effects**
  - "Dominant: Actions you play deal +2 damage"
  - "Dominant: Your close allies get +1 power"
  - "Dominant: At end of turn, deal 1 damage to a far enemy"
  - "Dominant: This unit has Shield 2"

**Cards to Implement:**
- 3-5 units with Dominant at different rarities
- Test which effects are too strong (always worth fighting for)
- Test which effects are too weak (ignored)

**Success Metric:** Playtesters fight for control of specific lanes to activate Dominant

---

### 2.4 🏆 Conquer Rework
**Why Important:** Simplifies resolution, makes high-value units obvious. Adds bonus SP without card draw snowball.

- [ ] **New Conquer Definition**
  - Conquer is a UNIT ability (keyword on the unit)
  - When a unit with Conquer wins its lane, the player gets +1 SP (in addition to the base 1 SP for winning)
  - Default: Win lane = 1 SP
  - With Conquer unit: Win lane = 2 SP (base 1 + Conquer 1)
  
- [ ] **Conquer Keyword Display**
  - "Conquer" text on unit card
  - Flag/trophy icon in keyword symbols (see 1.4)
  - Tooltip: "If this unit wins its lane, gain +1 SP"
  
- [ ] **Visual Indication**
  - Units with Conquer show flag/trophy icon on board frame
  - When counting SP at round end, clearly show Conquer bonuses
  - Example: "Lane 2: Won (+1 SP) + Conquer (+1 SP) = 2 SP"
  
- [ ] **SP Calculation**
  - At round end: For each lane won, check if winning unit has Conquer
  - Base SP + Conquer SP = Total SP for that lane
  - Display in scoreboard (see 1.8)

**Cards to Implement:**
- Units with Conquer at different rarities
  - Bronze: Lower power units with Conquer (e.g., 3 power + Conquer)
  - Silver: Medium power with Conquer + other ability
  - Gold: High power with Conquer + strong effect
- Test if Conquer units become auto-includes (too strong)
- Test if Conquer is worth the deckbuilding slot

**Design Questions:**
- Can multiple units in same lane have Conquer? (If replacing units)
- Does Conquer stack? (e.g., unit replaced had Conquer, new unit has Conquer = 2 bonus SP?) - Probably NO, since only winning unit matters

**Success Metric:** Playtesters prioritize lanes with Conquer units, fight to protect/kill them

---

### 2.5 📍 Deploy Restrictions (Empty Slots Only)
**Why Important:** Makes decisions more impactful. Can't freely replace units.

- [ ] **Enforce Rule**
  - Units can ONLY deploy to empty slots
  - If slot occupied by your unit, can't deploy there (unless Consume)
  
- [ ] **Consume Keyword**
  - Exception to rule: "Consume"
  - Units with Consume CAN deploy on top of other units
  - Acts like M1 sacrifice mechanic
  - Example: "Consume: Deploy: Deal damage equal to consumed unit's power"
  
- [ ] **UI Feedback**
  - Occupied slots are un-targetable (grayed out)
  - Hover shows tooltip: "Slot occupied"
  - Consume units CAN target occupied slots

**Cards to Implement:**
- A few Consume units (2-3 for testing)
- Test strategic impact: Does this create interesting decisions?

**Success Metric:** Playtesters think ahead about slot usage, occasionally "strangled" by full board

---

### 2.6 🔄 Move Action
**Why Important:** Adds tactical repositioning. Counters bad matchups, enables positional synergies.

- [ ] **Move as an Action**
  - Moving is an ACTION that units can perform (not a trigger keyword)
  - Typically through activated abilities: "Activate: Move to a close empty slot"
  - Or granted by other cards: "Deploy: Move a close ally to an empty slot"
  
- [ ] **Movement Rules**
  - Can only move to adjacent empty slots (Close positioning)
  - Cannot move to occupied slots (respects deploy restrictions from 2.5)
  - Moving DOES trigger Deploy effects? (Test and decide)
    - If YES: Movement is powerful (re-triggers abilities)
    - If NO: Movement is pure repositioning
  
- [ ] **Visual System**
  - When activated, highlight valid move destinations (adjacent empty slots)
  - Movement animation (unit slides from slot to slot)
  - Clear indication that unit moved (brief glow/trail effect?)
  
- [ ] **Example Movement Abilities**
  - "Activate: Move this unit to a close empty slot"
  - "Deploy: Move a close ally to an empty slot" (enables ally to reposition)
  - "Activate: Swap this unit with a close ally" (if testing swapping)

**Cards to Implement:**
- 2-3 units with movement abilities for testing
- Test if movement is worth an activated ability slot
- Test different movement costs/restrictions

**Design Questions:**
- Does moving trigger Deploy effects? (Major balance implication)
- Should swapping be allowed, or only empty-slot moves?
- Is movement a quick action or main action?
- Do movement abilities cost charges, or are they unlimited per turn?

**Success Metric:** Playtesters use movement to reposition, dodge bad matchups, set up positional synergies (Close ally buffs)

---

### 2.7 🎯 Multi-Targeting System
**Why Important:** Some effects need multiple targets to be interesting.

- [ ] **Sequential Targeting UI**
  - Player selects first target
  - UI prompts: "Select second target"
  - Player selects second target
  - Effect resolves on both
  
- [ ] **Cancel Functionality**
  - Right-click or ESC to cancel after first target
  - Card returns to hand (doesn't consume)
  
- [ ] **Example Cards**
  - "Deal 2 damage to two different enemies"
  - "Give two close allies +2 power each"

**Cards to Implement:**
- 2-3 cards with multi-targeting for testing

**Success Metric:** Targeting flow is intuitive, no confusion about how to select targets

---

  - Track playtesting feedback per card
  - Version history for balance changes
  
- [ ] **Half-Deck Method (from your design process)**
  - 5 half-decks with concepts:
    1. Aggro (high power, direct damage)
    2. Control (removal, healing)
    3. Ongoing (slot buffs, long-term value)
    4. Sacrifice (fodder units, burst value)
    5. Tactical (bounce, move, card draw)
  
  - Shuffle combinations for testing
  - Discover synergies and gaps

---

### 4.3 🧪 Playtesting Plan

**Core Mechanics Validation:**
- [ ] Shield: Do players understand? Is it fun?
- [ ] Dominant: Is it clear when active? Worth fighting for?
- [ ] Leaders: Are charges balanced? Do they add strategy?
- [ ] Quick Actions: Does manual pass feel better?
- [ ] Conquer: Are high-value lanes obvious?
- [ ] Move: Does it add strategy or complicate?

**Card-Specific Tests:**
- [ ] Which cards are never played? (remove or redesign)
- [ ] Which cards are always played? (might be too strong)
- [ ] Which archetypes win most?
- [ ] Which archetypes are most fun?

**Data to Collect:**
- [ ] **Game Data:** Winner, cards played, skirmish scores, length
- [ ] **Post-Game Questions:** Strategy, powerful/weak cards, fun moments, confusion points
- [ ] **Observations:** Did players use leaders? Did they fight for Dominant lanes?

**Tools:**
- Google Forms for questions
- Game logs exported to CSV
- Dashboard to view win rates, card usage

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR M2

**Goal:** People are EXCITED to playtest, not doing you a favor

**Success Looks Like:**
- Playtesters say "this looks really cool, I want to keep playing"
- Playtesters understand game state without asking questions
- Playtesters use leaders strategically
- Playtesters make interesting decisions (Dominant lanes, Shield priority, Conquer slots)
- Playtesters finish sessions and immediately want to build a new deck
- Playtesters bring friends to try it
- You get unsolicited feedback because people care about the game

**Failure Looks Like:**
- Playtesters say "I don't really get what's happening"
- Playtesters ask "what did that card do?" frequently
- Playtesters never use leader abilities (forgot or don't understand)
- Playtesters quit mid-game out of boredom or confusion
- You have to beg for follow-up sessions

## 📌 KEY PRINCIPLES FOR M2

1. **Visual Clarity First**
   - Animations make events clear
   - Icons reduce text reading
   - Board is readable at a glance

2. **Strategic Depth Second**
   - Leaders add consistent strategic layer
   - New mechanics (Shield, Dominant) create interesting decisions
   - Rarity system forces deckbuilding tradeoffs

3. **Polish Throughout**
   - Every feature implemented should look good, not just work
   - Placeholder art is OK temporarily, but replace ASAP
   - UI should feel responsive and smooth

4. **Iterate on Feedback**
   - Start playtesting early (after Week 6)
   - Collect data systematically
   - Be willing to cut features that don't work

5. **Quality Over Speed**
   - Take time to do animations right
   - Get art style consistent before mass-producing cards
   - Don't ship broken features to hit arbitrary deadlines

**END OF M2 PRIORITIZED ROADMAP**

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this roadmap
2. Confirm priorities (anything missing or wrong order?)
3. Set up animation system (Framer Motion or React Spring)
4. Start with Week 1-2: Foundation (animations + basic art)
5. Ship to first playtesters by Week 6

**You've got this! The game is already functional from M1 - M2 is about making it SHINE.** 🎮✨
