# M2 High-Level Roadmap - Skirmish

## 💎 Project Motivation: Why Skirmish?

**The Personal Vision:**
Skirmish is my creative outlet, my "baby" (even though I have a real two-month-old baby at home). This is about taking a project from start to finish—learning, building, shipping. It's about proving to myself that I can see something through to completion.

**The Goal:**
Ship a fully-fledged card game on iOS, Android, and Steam by 2026.

**The Reality:**
It might not be the best game ever. It might only be played by me and a couple of friends for three days. And that's okay. This isn't about commercial success or going viral—it's about having something I built from scratch that I can be proud of.

**What I'll Learn:**
- Taking a game from prototype → polished product → shipped
- Game design, balance, and iteration
- Art direction and visual polish
- Platform deployment (mobile + desktop)
- Project management and execution
- Finishing what I started

**Why M2 Matters:**
M1 proved the game works. M2 is about making it look and feel like a real game—polished enough that playtesters are excited to try it, strategic enough that people want to keep playing. M2 transforms blocky prototype into something that feels legitimate.

M2 is the bridge from "I made a thing" to "I made a GAME."

## 🗺️ The Journey to 2026

### M1: **Proof of Concept** ✅ Complete
- Core gameplay functional
- Network play works
- AI opponent testable
- **Question answered:** "Does the game work?"

### M2: **Early Playtesting** 🎯 Current Phase
- Transform from prototype to polished game
- Visual polish, strategic depth, playtester appeal
- Leaders, Shield, Dominant mechanics implemented
- Gather serious feedback from excited playtesters
- **Question to answer:** "Is the game fun and worth playing?"

### M3: **Meta, Juice and Finalize Game** 📍 Future
- Full card pool (150-200+ cards)
- Faction system implementation
- Multiple viable archetypes and meta
- Final polish, animations, sound effects
- Balance refinement
- **Question to answer:** "Is the game complete and polished?"

### M4: **Marketing, Publishing and Beyond** 🚀 The Finish Line
- iOS, Android, Steam deployment
- Marketing and launch strategy
- Community building
- Post-launch support
- **Question to answer:** "How do I get this to players?"

**M2's Role:** M2 is where we prove the game is worth finishing. If playtesters aren't excited during early playtesting, there's no point in building more content or shipping to platforms.

## 🚀 Success Criteria

**M2 is successful when:**

### Player Experience:
- Players say "this looks really cool, I want to keep playing"
- Players understand game state without asking questions
- Players use Leaders strategically and find them fun
- Players finish sessions and immediately want to build new decks
- Players bring friends to try the game

### Quality Indicators:
- Animations provide clarity (players know what happened)
- Visual design generates excitement (not just "functional")
- Strategic depth creates interesting decisions
- Network play is smooth enough for remote testing
- Feedback is substantive (not "it's nice, I guess")

### Red Flags (What Failure Looks Like):
- ❌ Players ask "what's happening?" frequently
- ❌ Players never use Leader abilities (forgot or don't understand)
- ❌ Players quit mid-game out of boredom
- ❌ You have to beg for follow-up sessions
- ❌ Feedback is vague or overly polite

## ⚡ Core Principles for M2 (and Beyond)

### 1. **Quality Over Speed**
No timeline pressure. This is a learning journey, not a race. Take the time to do things right, learn from mistakes, and build something to be proud of.

### 2. **Ship, Don't Perfect**
Balance quality with progress. The goal is to FINISH, not to make it perfect. Ship M2 when it's good enough to excite playtesters, then iterate based on real feedback.

### 3. **Visual Clarity First**
Every feature should be clear at a glance. Good design means players understand what's happening without confusion. Icons, animations, and UI should help, not hinder.

### 4. **Learn as You Go**
This project is about learning game design, development, art, balance, and shipping. Embrace the learning curve—every challenge is a skill gained.

### 5. **Make It Feel Good**
Animations, sound effects, and UI responsiveness matter. The game should feel satisfying to play, not just functional. Juice and polish are not optional.

### 6. **Iterate on Real Feedback**
Don't build in a vacuum. Playtest early and often. Listen to feedback, but filter it through your vision. This is YOUR game—make decisions you believe in.

### 7. **Finish What You Start**
The ultimate goal is shipping on iOS, Android, and Steam by 2026. Every phase (M2, M3, M4) is a step toward that finish line. Stay focused on completing each phase, then move to the next.
