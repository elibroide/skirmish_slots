# Strategy Guide

## Resource Management

### Cards Are Your Only Resource

**Key Insight:** No mana, no energy—just the cards in your hand

**Implications:**
- Every card played is gone for this skirmish
- Passing early saves cards for next skirmish
- Card advantage is crucial
- Drawing cards is extremely valuable (Scout, Noble)

**Strategy:**
- Don't overcommit to a losing skirmish
- Save cards if you're already winning
- Invest heavily in skirmishes you can win

---

### Consume Mechanics

**Converts units into effects**

**Value Proposition:**
- Sacrifice a weak unit (Acolyte) for a strong effect
- Turn losing battles into card advantage
- Dragon costs 2 cards but gives 7 power

**Synergies:**
- Acolyte (1) + Dragon (7) = 10 power for 2 cards
- Warlock consumes Acolyte = 4 damage + Acolyte buff
- Apprentice turns any unit into a draw

---

## Terrain Priority

### You Only Need 3 of 5 Terrains

**Strategic Concession:**
- Can abandon 2 terrains completely
- Concentrate forces on 3 winnable terrains
- Opponent must spread resources or lose

**Example:**
- You play 4 units on terrains 0, 1, 2
- Opponent plays 5 units spread across all terrains
- You win 3 terrains decisively, concede 2
- Result: You win skirmish with fewer cards spent

**When to Concede:**
- Opponent has overwhelming power on a terrain
- You're running out of cards
- You've already secured 3 other terrains

## Slot Modifiers

### Building Key Terrains

**Permanent Investment:**
- Slot modifiers last the entire skirmish
- Stack additively (+1 +2 +1 = +4)
- Cleared between skirmishes

**Cards That Build Slots:**
- **Engineer:** +1 per turn on his slot
- **Roots:** +X on death (where X = his power)
- **Wizard:** +2 when you play actions
- **Rookie:** +2 to his slot and a close slot
- **Seed:** +1 to a slot and close slots

**Strategy:**
- Identify your key terrain early
- Stack multiple modifiers on it
- Deploy units there to benefit from stacking
- Protect it from cleanse effects (Priest)

**Example Combo:**
- Turn 1: Deploy Engineer to terrain 2
- Turn 2: Engineer slot now +1
- Turn 3: Play Seed on terrain 2 (+2 total)
- Turn 4: Deploy Champion there (5+2 = 7 power)

---

## Conquer Strategy

### Conquer Triggers on Terrain Win

**Key Card:** Noble (4 power, Conquer: Draw 2)

**Value:**
- Conquer triggers even if you lose the skirmish
- Noble's 2 card draw = massive value
- Can "trade" a skirmish for card advantage

**Greedy Strategy:**
- Deploy Nobles on 2 terrains
- Concede other 3 terrains
- Lose skirmish 2-3
- Draw 4 cards from Nobles
- Win next skirmish with card advantage

**Timing:**
- Conquer happens left to right (terrain 0 → 4)
- Player 1 first, then Player 2
- Draw cards before next skirmish starts

---

## Passing Dynamics

### When to Pass Early

**Pass When Ahead:**
- You control 3+ terrains
- Opponent would need multiple cards to catch up
- Lock in your advantage

**Pass When Behind:**
- You cannot win this skirmish
- Save remaining cards for next skirmish
- Force opponent to keep playing if they want to win

**Force Overcommitment:**
- Pass early when you have 2 terrains
- Opponent must play more cards to secure 3
- You save cards for next skirmish

---

### When to Keep Playing

**You're Close:**
- You control 2 terrains, can contest 1 more
- One card could swing the skirmish

**Opponent Passed:**
- Opponent locked out
- You can play freely without response
- Win the skirmish with minimum investment

**Card Advantage:**
- You have many cards in hand
- Opponent likely running low
- Win this skirmish, pressure next one

## Common Timing Questions (FAQ)

### Q: When does Engineer's ability trigger?
**A:** At START of your turn, before you play a card.

---

### Q: Can I activate multiple abilities in one turn?
**A:** Yes! Activate as many ready abilities as you want.

---

### Q: Does Fireball damage my own units?
**A:** YES! It damages ALL units close to the target (yours and opponent's).

---

### Q: If I lose the skirmish but my Noble won its terrain, does Conquer trigger?
**A:** YES! Conquer cares about the terrain, not the skirmish.

---

### Q: What happens if both players tie for SP?
**A:** Both players get 1 match win. If both reach 2 wins this way, it's a draw.

---

### Q: Can I skip my turn to pass it to my opponent?
**A:** NO! You must play a card or activate abilities to pass the turn. If you do nothing, you're declaring "Done" and locked out.

---

### Q: If I'm done, can my opponent keep playing?
**A:** Yes! They can play as many turns as they want until they also declare "Done".

---

### Q: Do slot modifiers carry over between skirmishes?
**A:** NO! Everything clears (units and slot modifiers). Only graveyard and hands persist.

---

### Q: Can I deploy a unit to a terrain where I already have one?
**A:** Yes! The new unit replaces the old one (old one dies).

---

### Q: When does Bard's ability trigger?
**A:** At START of your turn, close allies get +1. This happens every turn Bard survives.
